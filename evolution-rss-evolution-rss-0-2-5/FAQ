Evolution crashes when using gtkmozembed as a render?
=====================================================

Problems have been spotting when running evolution under Ubuntu and prbably on Debian too.
This is a well known bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/26436/),
as many other application crash when they embed firefox with gtkmozembed.
There are 2 fixes for that:

 - either run evolution with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/firefox/lib evolution
 - either app into ld.so.conf /path/to/firefox and run ldconfig afterwards
 - install and compile evolution-rss against xulrunner-1.9"

 or you can choose to render articles using Webkit

How can enable webkit in evolution-rss?
=======================================

Enabling webkit in evolution-rss requires webkit especially Gdk part to be compiled.
For complete instructions see:

	http://gnome.eu.org/evo/index.php/WebKit

After instalation is complete you have to recompile evolution-rss. Hopefully evolution-rss
build script will detech webkit's gdk stuff. Hopefully this will sooner be a package on each
distro, coz building webkit takes long ! (3+ hrs)
After you recompiled evolution-rss you can setup HTML render in Edit->Preferences->News&Blogs
under HTML tab.

What does "Validate feed" mean?
===============================

Adding feed when poor conection can be really slow. Imagine you have a 350+ opml file and
each feeds needs to be feched before setup, this will take enourmous amount of time, so
you can just skip this step by unchecking Validate feed option. Feeds will be read,
afterwards one by one.
