# Ev2W
<strong>Gnome EVOLUTION email client and calendar ported to MSYS2/MinGW64 using GTK.</strong><br><br>
DIY open-source email security tool for Windows. Update and refresh of original work courtesy Novell, Inc., The GNOME Foundation, SUSE and Debian Linux groups, the MSYS2 team and others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Evolution" target="_blank">Evolution</a> usage is granted under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). <br><br>
<strong>What is working?</strong> User interface, GCONF, dll plugins and printing. Tested protocols include email send-receive over SMTP and IMAP with CRAM-MD5, LDAP and CalDAV, all using SSL/TLS (implicit) and STARTTLS (opportunistic) encryption types. HTML images over HTTPS also load. SSLv3 is still enabled but is not advised for security reasons. Successfully tested with GMail(via [2FA](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)), Outlook.com, Exchange and Linux services like [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/), Courier IMAP, OpenLDAP, [DAViCal](https://www.davical.org/), etc. Full-time encryption (e.g. IMAP port 993) needs to be configured as "SSL". This is just how the interface was, "SSL" really meant any implicit encryption type. And like older versions of Outlook, "TLS" actually referred to STARTTLS elevation from the unencrypted port.<br>
<strong>What is not working yet?</strong> Camel PGP digital signature functions still need to be ported to Windows (fork).<br><br>
<strong>How does it work?</strong><br>This project is not yet "average-user ready". Ev2W needs to be compiled and installed from source code. For now, Ev2W functions from within an existing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30069830/how-can-i-install-mingw-w64-and-msys2">MinGW64</a> directory structure, with executable and dlls in 'bin', configuration in 'etc', assets in 'share', etc. So users will need to install core GTK2-related packages from the MSYS2 project <a href="https://packages.msys2.org/package/?repo=mingw64">w64-x86_64</a> binaries (not MSYS, MinGW32 or CLANG). TLS requires MinGW64 <a href="https://n-2.org/">NSS/NSPR</a> development libraries built with SQLite support. Users will also need to clone, build and install all of the dependency libraries under "asctime/Ev2W-Depends". We have carefully organised example GNU Makefile structures in each subfolder of each related Ev2W project, in a 'mingw64' sub-sub-folder. Users are free to use these directly, or simply as a guide in rolling their own. Constructive feedback is welcome. Evolution 2.32 REQUIRES a <a href="//github.com/asctime/Ev2W-Depends">running DBUS daemon</a> and GCONF-2 installation on Windows, which provides compile-time dependencies as well runtime inter-process communication and configuration. Bonobo/CORBA is not required for compiling Ev2W.<br><br>
<strong>What is the goal?</strong><br>Getting the existing "last-known-to-be-working" Windows codebase fully operational under MinGW64 would be a start. The experience would probably be very useful in launching a MinGW64 release of Evolution 3.x upstream, GTK3-based, improved security with all GCONF dependencies re-pointed to the Windows native registry. Project is LGPL, so there is no obvious benefit to directly support LLVM toolchains. Nor do we have a requirement for a 32-bit version (might change).
