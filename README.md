# Ev2W
<strong>Gnome EVOLUTION email client and calendar ported to MSYS2/MinGW64 using GTK.</strong><br><br>
Update and refresh of original work courtesy Novell, Inc., The GNOME Foundation, SUSE and Debian Linux groups, the MSYS2 team and others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Evolution" target="_blank">Evolution</a> usage is granted under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). <br><br>
<strong>What is working?</strong> User interface, GCONF, dll plugins, most protocols like SMTP, IMAP with CRAM-MD5 over SSL, CalDAV and LDAP(S).<br>
<strong>What is not working yet?</strong> Some message image loading, GTK2 printing (see <a href="https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/14787">bug</a>), binary release, proper instructions and documentation.. <br><br>
<strong>How does it work?</strong><br>This project is not yet "average-user ready". Ev2W needs to be compiled and installed from source code. For now, Ev2W functions from within an existing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30069830/how-can-i-install-mingw-w64-and-msys2">MinGW64</a> directory structure, with executable and dlls in 'bin', configuration in 'etc', assets in 'share', etc. So you will need to install core GTK2-related packages from the MSYS2 project first. Use the MinGW64 releases, NOT the MinGW32 or MSYS2. See 'asctime/MINGW-2023-01-13' fork for MinGW code freeze and organizing PRs back to the MSYS2 team. You will also need to clone, build and install all of the dependency libraries under "asctime/Ev2W-Depends". We have carefully organised example GNU Makefile structures in each subfolder of each related Ev2W project, in a 'mingw64' sub-sub-folder. You are free to use these directly, or simply as a guide in rolling your own. Constructive feedback is welcome. Evolution 2.32 REQUIRES a <a href="//github.com/asctime/Ev2W-Depends">running DBUS daemon</a> and GCONF-2 installation on Windows, which provides compile-time dependencies as well runtime inter-process communication and configuration. Bonobo/CORBA is still required for compiling one or two dependencies but not for actual Evolution functionality in this version.<br><br>
<strong>What is the goal?</strong><br>Getting the existing "last-known-to-be-working" Windows codebase fully operational under MinGW64 would be a start. The experience would probably be very useful in launching a MinGW64 release of Evolution 3.x upstream, GTK3-based, improved security with all GCONF dependencies re-pointed to the Windows native registry. Project is LGPL, so there is no obvious benefit to directly support LLVM toolchains. Nor do we have a requirement for a 32-bit version (might change).
