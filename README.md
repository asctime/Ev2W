# Evo2W
<strong>Evo2W (Evolution 2.x email address book and calendar client, for Windows) based on MSYS2/MinGW64 and GTK2</strong><br><br>
Update and refresh of original work courtesy Novell, Inc., The GNOME Foundation, SUSE and Debian Linux groups, the MSYS2 team and possible others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Evolution" target="_blank">Evolution</a> is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). <br><br>
<strong>What is working?</strong> User interface, GCONF, several protocols like IMAP and SMTP, CalDAV, LDAP/LDAPS and more.<br>
<strong>What is not working yet?</strong> Some encryption protocols, some message image loading, GTK2 printing (see <a href="https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/14787">bug</a>), binary release, proper instructions and documentation.. <br><br>
<strong>How does it work?</strong><br>This project is not yet "average-user ready". Evo2W needs to be compiled and installed from source code. For now, Evo2W functions from within an existing MinGW64 directory structure, with executable and dlls in 'bin', configuration in 'etc', assets in 'share', etc. So you will need to install core GTK2-related packages from the MSYS2 project first. Use the MinGW64 releases, NOT the MinGW32 or MSYS2. See 'asctime/MINGW-2023-01-13' fork for MinGW code freeze and organizing PRs back to the MSYS2 team. You will also need to clone, build and install all of the dependency libraries under "asctime/Evo2W-Depends" and "asctime/Gnome-2". We have carefully organised example GNU Makefile structures in each subfolder of each related Evo2W project, in a 'mingw64' sub-sub-folder. You are free to use these directly, or simply as a guide in rolling your own. Constructive feedback is welcome. Evolution 2.32 REQUIRES a <a href="//github.com/asctime/Evo2W-Depends">running DBUS daemon</a> and GCONF-2 installation on Windows, which provides compile-time dependencies as well runtime inter-process communication and configuration. Bonobo/CORBA is still required for compiling one or two dependencies but not for actual Evolution functionality in this version.<br><br>
<strong>What is the goal?</strong><br>Getting the existing "last-known-to-be-working" Windows codebase fully operational under MinGW64 would be a start. The experience would probably be very useful in launching a MinGW64 release of Evolution 3.x upstream, GTK3-based, improved security with all GCONF dependencies re-pointed to the Windows native registry and any Gnome references re-pointed to Windows themes - possibly eliminate Gnome desktop library dependencies for Evo2W entirely (example, see evolution-2.32.3\plugins\mail-notification\mail-notification.c). Possible MinGW64 PKGBUILD compilation and installation depending on level of interest from MSYS2 team. As the project is LGPL, there is no obvious benefit to directly support LLVM toolchains, nor will we have the bandwidth to do a 32-bit version (might change).
