<para>
<application>Outlook</application> lets you view
<application>Exchange</application> Public Folders in a "Conversation"
mode similar to <application>Evolution</application>'s "Threaded"
mode. However, it doesn't do it via <literal>In-Reply-To</literal> or
<literal>References</literal> headers. <link
linkend="CamelExchangeFolder">CamelExchangeFolder</link> translates
<application>Exchange</application>'s system so that the messages
thread properly in <application>Evolution</application>
</para>

<para>
A new post to a folder gets a 27-byte-long "thread index". (The value
is apparently unique but has no meaning we know of.) Each reply to a
new post gets a thread index that starts with the original post's
thread index, followed by 5 additional bytes. (Thus, the reply to a
new post would have a 32-byte-long thread index, and a reply to that
post would have a 37-byte-long thread index, etc.)
</para>

<para>
The <literal>Thread-Index</literal> header contains a base64
representation of this value. <link
linkend="CamelExchangeFolder">CamelExchangeFolder</link> keeps a hash
table mapping from <literal>Thread-Index</literal> values to
<literal>Message-ID</literal>s. When it finds a message with a
<literal>Thread-Index</literal> but no <literal>In-Reply-To</literal>
or <literal>References</literal>, it looks up the parent thread index
(ie, all but the last 5 bytes) in the hash, and (assuming it finds
it), fakes a <literal>References</literal> header pointing to it.
