<para>
Delegation is a hodgepodge of several different bits of functionality.
The big picture idea is "someone else deals with your mail or
calendar, or you deal with theirs".
</para>

<para>
When you make someone a delegate in
<application>Outlook</application>, the dialog lets you do a bunch of
things:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
	You can edit their permissions on all of your folders in
	one easy place.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
	If you give them "Editor" permission on your Calendar,
	you can cause them to also get copies of your meeting
	requests.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
	If you make at least one person get copies of your
	meeting requests, you can make yourself not get them any
	more.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
	You can make it possible (on a per-delegate basis) for
	your delegates to be able to see "Private" appointments,
	contacts, and tasks in your folders. (Normally other
	people can't see your Private items regardless of what
	permissions you give them.)
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
	Your delegate automatically becomes able to send mail from
	your address. <application>Outlook</application> doesn't
	actually allow you to enable/disable this functionality
	independently of calling someone a delegate, although it's
	possible to do so.
    </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Different pieces of this information are stored in different places:
</para>

<orderedlist>
    <listitem><para>
	Permissions information is stored in the <link
	linkend="ximian-connector-permissions">security
	descriptors</link> of the relevant folders.
	<application>Outlook</application> always adds the user to
	each of the delegatable folders (Inbox, Calendar, Contacts,
	Journal, Notes, and Tasks) even if they only have "None"
	permission there. The user is also added to the security
	descriptor of the "Freebusy Data" folder in the <link
	linkend="ximian-connector-non-ipm">non-IPM subtree</link>,
	with None or Reviewer permission if they have None or Reviewer
	on Calendar, and Editor permission if they have Author or
	Editor on Calendar.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
	Who-can-send-mail-as-who data is kept in <application>Active
	Directory</application>. Your delegates are stored in the
	multivalued <literal>publicDelegates</literal> property on
	your AD entry. When you modify that property, AD automatically
	maintains back links in other entries'
	<literal>publicDelegatesBL</literal> properties. (Thus, by
	checking your own <literal>publicDelegatesBL</literal>
	property, you can find out who you are a delegate for.)
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem>
	<para>
	    Three multivalued MAPI properties on
	    <uri>NON_IPM_SUBTREE/Freebusy%20Data/LocalFreebusy.EML</uri>
	    also track your delegates:
	</para>

    <listitem><para>
	Meeting request forwarding is controlled by a <link

	Inbox with a <literal>PR_RULE_MSG_PROVIDER</literal> of
