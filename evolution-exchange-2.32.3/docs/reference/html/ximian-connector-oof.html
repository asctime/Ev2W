<span class="application">Exchange</span> allows you to automatically send
"Out of Office" notifications to anyone who sends you mail. There are
two parts to this.
</p>
<p>
The first part is creating the server-side rule to be run
when you are out of the office. The simple case (which is all that
Connector supports) is to have a single rule that sends a simple reply
to all "out-of-officeable" messages. (I don't know Exchange's exact
rule, but I think it won't send a reply to any message that doesn't
include you as an explicit recipient, and it won't send the message
more than once to any recipient in any given out-of-office period.)
</p>
<p>
Connector doesn't currently support creating server-side rules at all,
so we handle the out-of-office rule by using
<span class="application">OWA</span>'s Options page. This is pretty much a
kludge, but it works for simple out-of-office messages, and we haven't
gotten any bug reports against it yet...
</p>
<p>
The second part is turning the out-of-office state on or off. This is
controlled by a MAPI property on the message store itself, which we
can't access via WebDAV. (The message store is not the same as the
root folder of the message store.) So again, we use
<span class="application">OWA</span> to do this.
</p>
<p>
Connector (like <span class="application">Outlook</span>) checks the
out-of-office state at startup time, and offers to turn it off if it
is on.
