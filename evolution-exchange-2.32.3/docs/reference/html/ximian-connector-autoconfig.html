<p>
Because <span class="application">Exchange</span> wasn't really designed for
what Connector tries to do with it, there are a lot of different
configuration possibilities that Connector needs to deal with.
Autoconfiguration attempts to figure all of these out automatically so
that the user doesn't need to enter in any more information than is
absolutely necessary.
</p>
<div class="refsect2" title="The Initial WebDAV Connection">
<a name="id2969971"></a><h3>The Initial WebDAV Connection</h3>
<p>
To start things off, the user must provide three pieces of
information: an <span class="application">OWA</span> URL, a username, and a
password. The <span class="application">OWA</span> URL is used because it
encodes several important pieces of information, and the user should
already know what it is (and if not, it should be easy for them to
find out by asking someone).
</p>
<p>
If the provided URL doesn't start with "<code class="literal">http://</code>" or
"<code class="literal">https://</code>", Connector prepends that. From the URL
we get:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Whether or not to use SSL (based on whether the
    provided URL is <code class="literal">http</code> or
    <code class="literal">https</code>).</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The name of the
    <span class="application">Exchange</span> server to connect to (which
    may just be a front-end <span class="application">OWA</span> server).
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The port number to use, if non-standard
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="application">OWA</span> path
    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Possibly</em></span> the user's mailbox
    name (if they provided a URL like
    <code class="uri">http://example.com/exchange/<em class="replaceable"><code>mailbox-name</code></em></code>
    rather than just <code class="uri">http://example.com/exchange/</code>).
    </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
Using that, Connector tries to log in to
<span class="application">OWA</span> and fetch the HTML data. There are
various results possible:
</p>
<div class="variablelist"><table border="0">
<col align="left" valign="top">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="literal">E2K_HTTP_CANT_RESOLVE</code></span></p></td>
<td><p>The hostname can't be resolved. Connector will
	suggest that the user check for typos and try again.
	</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="literal">E2K_HTTP_CANT_CONNECT</code></span></p></td>
<td><p>Can't connect to server. Connector suggests the
	user check that the hostname is correct, and also suggests
	toggling <code class="literal">http</code>/<code class="literal">https</code>,
	since it's possible the server may only be listening on one
	port.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="literal"><span class="errorcode">302</span> <span class="errorname">Moved Temporarily</span></code></span></p></td>
<td>
<p>There are three possibilities, depending on
	the final component of the redirect URL:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><table border="0">
<col align="left" valign="top">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="uri">/logon.asp</code></span></p></td>
<td><p>The server is actually
		<span class="application">Exchange 5.5</span>. (Many users
		are quite convinced that their site uses
		<span class="application">Exchange 2000</span>, when in
		fact, they are still running 5.5.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="uri">/owalogon.asp</code></span></p></td>
<td><p>The server is using
		<span class="application">Exchange 2003</span> <a class="link" href="ximian-connector-fba.html" title="Exchange 2003 Forms-Based Authentication">forms-based authentication</a>.
		We attempt to authenticate via that, and try again.
		</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term">anything else</span></p></td>
<td><p>The server is redirecting us to
		another URL, so we try again there. This could happen
		if the administrator created a redirect from an
		easy-to-remember URL to the actual
		<span class="application">OWA</span> URL. Or it could mean
		that the user provided the wrong
		<span class="application">Exchange</span> server name, and
		the server is telling us to log in on a different
		machine instead.
		</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="literal"><span class="errorcode">401</span> <span class="errorname">Unauthorized</span></code></span></p></td>
<td>
<p>Again, there are several possibilities:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>If we were trying to use NTLM
	    authentication, but the server didn't offer NTLM, we can
	    try falling back to Basic auth.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Likewise, if we were trying to use Basic
	    authentication, but the server didn't offer it, we can try
	    NTLM.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>If we tried to use Basic auth, and didn't
	    provide an explicit domain name as part of the username,
	    then we can suggest that the user try that.
	    </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Of course, it is also always possible that the user just
	typed their password wrong, so we suggest that too.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="literal"><span class="errorcode">403</span> <span class="errorname">Forbidden</span></code></span></p></td>
<td><p>If the server requires SSL, it will sometimes
	be configured to return this error code on the standard HTTP
	port. The body of the response includes a message telling the
	user to use SSL, so we look for that, and try again with SSL
	if appropriate.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="literal"><span class="errorcode">404</span> <span class="errorname">Not Found</span></code></span></p></td>
<td>
<p>If we are certain that we are talking to an
	<span class="application">Exchange</span> server (because the
	response also included a "<code class="literal">MS-WebStorage</code>"
	header), then this means that the user doesn't have a mailbox
	on that server, and the server doesn't know where he does have
	a mailbox.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we didn't see a
	"<code class="literal">MS-WebStorage</code>" header, it probably means
	this isn't an <span class="application">Exchange</span>
	server.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term">Any <code class="literal"><span class="errorcode">2xx</span></code></span></p></td>
<td><p>We parse the returned HTML and see if it looks
	like <span class="application">OWA</span>. For <span class="application">Exchange
	2000</span> or <span class="application">Exchange
	2003</span>, we expect to see a
	<code class="literal">&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</code> containing the main
	<span class="application">OWA</span> frames. If we get back bad
	HTML, non-HTML, or HTML that looks like <span class="application">Exchange
	5.5</span>, we return an error.
	</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="refsect2" title="Further WebDAV Probes">
<a name="id2968129"></a><h3>Further WebDAV Probes</h3>
<p>
At this point, we should have the HTML of the
<span class="application">OWA</span> frame. (If we used NTLM authentication,
we may also have managed to extract the NT and <span class="application">Windows
2000</span> domain names from the NTLM challenge, which may be
needed later.) We extract the <code class="literal">BASE</code> element from the
HTML, and consider that to be the canonical form of the
<span class="application">OWA</span> URI. Because of how
<span class="application">OWA</span> works, this URI
<span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have the user's mailbox name in it, even if
the URI we started with did not.
</p>
<p>
The next thing we do is find the name of the server to use to access
public folders, by finding the "Public Folders" link in
<span class="application">OWA</span>. This is in a different location in
<span class="application">Exchange 2000</span> and <span class="application">Exchange
2003</span>, but hopefully we know which one we are talking at
this point, from looking at the "<code class="literal">MS-WebStorage</code>"
header. So we fetch the appropriate pane of
<span class="application">OWA</span> (the content pane for
<span class="application">Exchange 2000</span>, or the navigation bar for
<span class="application">Exchange 2003</span>), walk through the HTML
looking for the link, and remember the URI.
</p>
<p>
Then we do a <span class="command"><strong>BPROPFIND</strong></span> on the top level of the
mailbox to find the <code class="literal">PR_STORE_ENTRYID</code> (which can be
used to find the user's "<span class="application">Exchange 5.5</span> DN",
which can be used to uniquely identify the user in <span class="application">Active
Directory</span> later), and the time zone that the user
selected in <span class="application">OWA</span>. The time zone is mapped
from an <span class="application">Exchange</span> time zone to one of
<span class="application">Evolution</span>'s.
</p>
<p>
The use of <span class="command"><strong>BPROPFIND</strong></span> here is also for autodetection
purposes: if it fails, we return an error to the user explaining about
the <GTKDOCLINK HREF="ximian-connector-bug-bpropfind"><span class="application">IIS</span>
Lockdown <span class="command"><strong>BPROPFIND</strong></span> problem</GTKDOCLINK>.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility is that we will get an authentication error here
even though we had successfully authenticated before. This can happen
if we are using NTLM authentication, and the user's HTTP traffic is
being intercepted by a transparent web proxy that doesn't understand
NTLM (for reasons explained in the <a class="link" href="ximian-connector-ntlm.html#ximian-connector-ntlm-http" title="NTLM over HTTP">NTLM
notes</a>). So if this happens, we start over using Basic
authentication instead.
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="refsect2" title="The Global Catalog Server">
<a name="id2963455"></a><h3>The Global Catalog Server</h3>
<p>
At the moment, we can only autodetect the Global Catalog server if we
are using NTLM authentication and managed to autodetect the
<span class="application">Windows 2000</span> domain name before. In that
case, we do a DNS query for a service (<code class="literal">SRV</code>) record
for
<code class="literal">_gc._tcp.<em class="replaceable"><code>domain-name</code></em></code>",
which should give us the GC server name.
</p>
<p>
There are other possibilities we should try if we don't have the
domain name though: in almost all cases, the
<span class="application">Exchange</span> server hostname will be
"<em class="replaceable"><code>something</code></em>.<em class="replaceable"><code>domain-name</code></em>",
so we could also try that.
</p>
<p>
Given a connection to the Global Catalog, we use the
<span class="application">Exchange 5.5</span> DN detected earlier to find
the user and look up their full name and email address, and
autodetection is complete.

<div class="refsect2" title="Autoconfiguration Hints">
<a name="id2963522"></a><h3>Autoconfiguration Hints</h3>
<p>
It is possible for a system administrator to provide hints to the
autoconfig process, to make things easier on users. This is done by
creating a configuration file, which presumably would be installed
along with the Connector binary on each machine.
</p>
<p>
The configuration file can be stored in
<code class="filename">/etc/ximian/connector.conf</code>, or in
<code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>$PREFIX</code></em>/etc/connector.conf</code>.
It consists of a series of lines such as:
</p>
<div class="informalexample">
  <table class="listing_frame" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
