/* A popup action is an action that lives in a popup menu.  It proxies an
 * equivalent action in the main menu, with two differences:
 *
 * 1) If the main menu action is insensitive, the popup action is invisible.
 * 2) The popup action may have a different label than the main menu action.
 *
 * To use:
 *
 * Create an array of EPopupActionEntry structs.  Add the main menu actions
 * that serve as related actions for the popup actions to an action group
 * first.  Then pass the same action group and the EPopupActionEntry array
 * to e_action_group_add_popup_actions() to add popup actions.
