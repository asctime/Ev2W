The files in this directory are used by Evolution's control center
capplet to automatically configure email accounts.  This so that you
can tell it, "My mail is example@gmail.com" and it will automatically
figure out that it must use imap.googlemail.com and smtp.googlemail.com.

These files are copied from
http://live.mozillamessaging.com/autoconfig/

We should update these files periodically, maybe.

We duplicate these files (with various modifications) inside the
'api-web' module in git.

The come from:
  http://svn.mozilla.org/mozillamessaging.com/sites/autoconfig.mozillamessaging.com/trunk/

and should be re-synched with the Mozilla guys as often as possible.
The best thing to ping is: ispdb@googlegroups.com or for a
personal contact on the Mozilla side: Blake Winton bwinton mozillamessaging com
