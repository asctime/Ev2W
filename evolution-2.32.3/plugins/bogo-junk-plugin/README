Bogofilter plugin for Evolution

This plugin implements junk filtering for the Evolution mailer,
provided by the bogofilter utility. Bogofilter (http://www.bogofilter.org)
if a fast and nimble mail filter using a so-called Bayesian technique to
classify junk and non-junk email.

CAVEATS:

For Evolution versions before 2.5.2, the definition file for the stock
junk filter plugin, 'org-gnome-sa-junk-plugin.eplug', must be removed
from the plugin directory to avoid conflict with any alternate junk plugin.
Simply disabling the SA plugin in the configuration won't help.
This is due to a flaw in the loading code for this hook type
(see GNOME bug #313096).

To be able to classify emails as spam, bogofilter needs to have some
messages in its ham (non-spam) wordlist. This presents something of a
chicken-and-egg problem for Evolution, because it can feed messages
to the junk filter for learning as non-junk only after these messages have been
classified as junk and moved into a junk folder (GNOME bug #322105).
Thus, if you haven't got a pre-existing bogofilter database, you may need
to feed it some messages known to be non-junk, using its
command line utility:

bogofilter -n < saved-ham-message

Alternatively, you may use Spam Trainer, which is a GUI tool that supports
drag-and-drop from Evolution:

Set it up to use bogofilter commands for training:
  Ham command: bogofilter -n < %f
  Spam command: bogofilter -s < %f
