Adding Icons
------------

Icons that are meant to someday be themeable MUST be for one or more
of the following sizes:

- 16x16
- 18x18
- 20x20
- 24x24
- 32x32
- 48x48

(the following sizes may also be added for use with window
decorations: 64x64 and 128x128)

All icons should be named consistantly and be placed within the proper
subdir that corresponds to their size (if the subdir does not yet
exist, because no icons have been made for that size - then create the
subdir and add it to the build as well).

If it is expected that the icon(s) you've created will make it into
the GNOME icon themes package at some point (or is already there?),
then you will want to name your icons accordingly so that if the user
installs a GNOME icons theme package with the appropriate icon(s),
then he or she will see those icons rather than the ones installed by
default with Evolution.

The icons within the WWxHH subdirs will ONLY be used if they cnnot be
found in the theme.

The ONLY image files that may be placed in the toplevel art/ srcdir
(eg. *this* dir) are xpm files that are built into the Evolution binary
(or libs) and/or are not meant to be used as "icons".
